Welcome to the Vegetables API documentation.

## How to Read This Documentation

This documentation is intended more as reference material than something to read all the way through.
If you're new to Vegetables, you should start with the [README] and the [Tutorial].
Additionally, there is a page that provides a higher level organizational overview that you can find [here](./page/Organized_Listing.html).

The listings below are not exhaustive.
To see the full listings use the links at the top of the page.
Also, if you know what you're looking for, there is a search bar in the top left.
