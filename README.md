Vegetables
==========

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/vegetables/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/vegetables/commits/master)

For a healthier code base, eat your vegetables.

## Environment

In order to run this you will need:
* A reasonably recent version of gcc and gfortran
* The Haskell Stack tool, with packages MissingH, shake and split installed
  * I.e. `stack install MissingH shake split`

Running the tests is then as simple as

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/vegetables.git
cd vegetables
./shake.sh
```
